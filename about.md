<br>

<p>Hey there! I'm a graduate student in the <a href = "https://www.cs.cmu.edu">School of Computer Science</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. Here at Carnegie Mellon, I use statistics and machine learning algorithms to computationally solve complex biological problems. I am very passionate about algorithms and believe that if designed and implemented with prudence, they can change our world for the better.</p>

<p>For my undergrad, I went to <a href = "http://www.vit.ac.in">Vellore Institute of Technology</a> in India, where I graduated with a Bachelor's of Technology in Computer Science & Bioinformatics. Prior to coming to Carnegie Mellon, I worked as a Software Engineer at <a href = "https://www.accenture.com/us-en/new-applied-now">Accenture</a> for two years.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm looking for full-time opportunities in the areas of Machine Learning, Software Development and Data Analysis. If you think I would make a good potential fit for your company, or would like to collaborate or simply chat, please reach out to me at: <b><u>msaif@andrew.cmu.edu</u></b></p>
